# wordlists

A collections of wordlists, most found, some made.
A few of them are my compilations, most are found around the internet, 
avoiding the ones that were blindly generated without much review,
and de-duplicated and normalizing the rest.

Plus some other things I found interesting, like phrases, possibly password lists later.

Thanks to many other collectors, enthusiats, security sites, linguist hobbyists, and many more before me.


## Encoding

Various lists I found used an ASCII-safe coding of non-ASCII characters, or used codepages.

An attempt was made to make this all UTF-8 - though for languages I don't speak or understand well enough this is not guaranteed to be correct.

Where the coding is known to be unknown, it's marked with .decodeme.
I should get to it eventually.


## Attribution

Where wordlists had initial comments, those are left in. 
   ...so when loading them, you may want to ignore initial lines starting with #, which is the usual way to put in comments.

I will try to note the origin -- the name should be a hint at least -- but there are plenty of wordlists that I cannot find the origin of.
I assume those are usable without getting into trouble.

WARNING: ...but I advise you do not incorporate them into anything serious without YOU checking. Just saying.

There are othes that are clearly part of copyrighted software. 
I try to avoid them, but if you own the copyright for any and feel this is infringing, drop me a line, and I will try to link to them instead.



## Similarities

Say, words.english.websters is pretty similar to words.english.nltk, words.unabridged, words.look.freja.diku.dk. 
Probably because various wordlists are _probably_ based on others.

Also, YAWL, SOWPODS, and TWL06 (and others not yet added) are very smilar lists (90+% overlap),
used for scrabble and other word games.
