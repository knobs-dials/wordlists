# wordlists

A collection of wordlists I've found around - plus a little polishing.


## encoding

An attempt was made to make this all UTF-8

Various lists I found used an ASCII-safe coding of non-ASCII characters, or used codepages.

These were translated to be the actual characters and encoded in UTF-8, but since not all of them are languages I speak or understand well enouh,
there are no guarantees that is all correct. 


## attribution

Where wordlists had initial comments, those are left in. 
   ...so when loading them, you may want to ignore initial lines starting with #, which is the usual way to put in comments.

I will try to note the origin (the name should be a hint at least), but there are plenty of wordlists that I cannot find the origin of.

Relatedly, it seems most wordlists were made to be used fairly freely.
There are othes that are clearly part of copyrighted software. 
I try to avoid them, but if you own the copyright for any and feel this is infringing, drop me a line, and I will try to link to them instead.
